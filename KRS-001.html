        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          This document defines a Kraskaska Repository Specification
          (abbreviated as KRS). KRSes are documents defining specifications,
          protocols, standards, or any other information that requires rigid
          structuring and clear definitions. Besides the KRSes themselves this
          document also describes the process of creating a KRS, and getting it
          included into the official Kraskaska Repository.

            such.</i

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Kraskaska Repository Specification (abbreviated as KRS) is a process
          of defining standards in a rigid, structured format, as well as the
          name of the standards themselves. During this process, a new KRS is
          defined following the structure described in this KRS.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
          "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
          document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Process outline</h2>
        <p>Process is, generally, as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>A need for a standard appears.</li>
          <li>A draft of associated KRS is written.</li>
          <li>The KRS board MUST vote on whether the KRS is needed.</li>
          <li>
            If the vote passes, the KRS draft is now <i>under consideration</i>.
          </li>
          <li>The draft SHOULD be revised by interested parties.</li>
          <li>
            Interested parties MAY comment on the latest revision, suggesting
            changes and implementing them in a new revision. This is repeated,
            until...
          </li>
          <li>A final revision is made.</li>
          <li>
            The KRS board MUST vote on whether the final revision of KRS is
            ready for publication, following the established procedures.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the vote passes, the final revision of KRS is <i>published</i> in
            the repository, making the KRS official and granting it a
            <i> permanent KRS index </i>.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The KRS draft MAY get dropped after being put
          <i>under consideration</i>, if the parties become disinterested in the
          standardization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the KRS is published it MUST NOT be modified in any way, except
          for changing metadata, fixing formatting issues and correcting typos.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the need arises a newer KRS MAY <i>obsolete</i> an older published
          KRS. If that were to happen the newer KRS SHOULD be prioritised over
          the older obsoleted KRS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of obsoleting a newer KRS MAY instead <i>update</i> an
          existing published KRS. When referencing the KRS the original and all
          associated updates SHOULD be considered together. If the original KRS
          is obsoleted all KRSes that update the original MUST be considered
          obsolete as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the need arises there MAY be an <i>errata</i> published that
          corrects the mistakes in the contents of the KRS, or that explains
          vague details that were left out, accidentally or not. The erratas do
          not have their own index, but they MUST refer to a published KRS
          permanent index. The erratas, like KRSes, MUST NOT be modified in any
          way, except for changing metadata, fixing formatting issues and
          correcting typos.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Specification document structure</h2>
        <p>
          A KRS document MUST be a valid HTML5 document, containing an
          <code>html</code> tag with the attribute <code>lang</code> set to
          <code>en</code>. This section describes the structure of the document.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h3>3.1. Metadata</h3>
          <p>The document MUST contain a <code>head</code> tag.</p>
          <p>
            The <code>head</code> tag MUST contain a <code>title</code> tag
            containing the title of the KRS document, which follows the
            format:<br />
          </p>
          <pre><code>KRS-XXX: T</code></pre>
          <p>
            <code>XXX</code> is the permanent index assigned to the KRS, if any,
            with leading zeros to pad the index to at least 3 digits. If no
            permanent index is assigned to the document (due to it still being a
            draft or pending publication) the XXX MAY be set to the estimated
            index that would be granted to the KRS after publication, or the XXX
            MAY be set to the word "<code>PENDING</code>".
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>T</code> is the title of the standard, and it doesn't follow
            any semantics.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>head</code> MUST also contain a <code>script</code> tag
            with attribute <code>type</code> set to
            <code>application/yaml</code>. This tag contains YAML metadata
            specifying KRS properties in a machine readable form.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>3.2. Document body</h3>
          <p>
            The document MUST contain a <code>body</code> tag. In it there MUST
            be at least a <code>header</code> and a <code>main</code> tag. The
            body contains the description of the KRS written in formal English
            language.
          </p>
          <section>
            <h4>3.2.1. Header</h4>
            <p>
              The <code>header</code> tag MUST contain an <code>h1</code> that
              MUST match the contents of the previously defined
              <code>title</code> tag.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <code>header</code> MUST also contain a <code>p</code> tag or
              a <code>ul</code> tag containing the author or authors of the KRS
              document.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <code>header</code> MUST also contain a <code>p</code> tag
              specifying the SPDX of an OSI-approved license, which applies to
              the whole document. The KRS board will reject publication of KRSes
              that do not have an OSI-approved license.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <code>header</code> tag MAY contain other elements not defined
              here.
            </p>
