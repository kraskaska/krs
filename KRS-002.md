# KRS-002: KRS Markdown Document

by Kraskaska

**License:** BSD Zero Clause License

**Status:** published

## Abstract

This document defines an alternative document structure for the KRS documents utilizing GitHub-Flavored Markdown in place of regular KRS-001 HTML5 documents.

## 1. Introduction

HTML5 is a great file format, but at times it may be too verbose for the goals it wants to achieve, especially for KRS documents that may not need all the features of HTML5. This KRS specification aims to solve this problem by introducing an alternative KRS document structure utilizing GitHub-Flavored Markdown (abbreviated as GFM) instead of regular HTMl5 while retaining all the features defined in KRS-001.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## 2. Document structure

Each KRS document in this format MUST start with Markdown YAML frontmatter. The contents of the YAML MUST follow the structure defined in KRS-1, or its updated version/superseding version, except the key `schema` MUST be set to `KRS-002`.

After the frontmatter there MUST be a first-level heading that contains the title of the KRS document. It MUST follow the format of the metadata title of the HTML5 format described in KRS-001.

Following the title there MUST be paragraphs specifying the author, the license, and the status of the document, as well as the index of the KRS being updated and the list of indicies that are being obsoleted by this KRS if necessary. These paragraphs MUST follow the format of the respective fields in KRS-001.

After the paragraphs begin the sections of the document description. A section starts with a Markdown heading, optionally containing the body of the section and subsections.

There MUST be at least an "Abstract" section summarizing the KRS.

After all the sections there MAY be a footer added, denoted by `---`, with the contents following immediately after. The footer MAY contain the contact information of the document authors.
